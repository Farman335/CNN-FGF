****** Steps to reproduce the results ******

1: Extracted feature sets named AmpPseAAC.csv, CDT.csv, and KSCTD.csv from training and testing datasets. 
   
2: These feature set are provided of each descriptor.

3: The ML_classifiers.py file contains ERT, RF, and Adaboost to train models and predictions. 

4: 1DCNN_ok.py consists of CNN for model training and prediction. 

Note: To reproduce code, all dependencies libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib,	SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorchupdated versions should be installed
